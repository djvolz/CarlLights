Sequences:
  ☐ turn off lights
  ☐ christmas sequence
    ☐ christmas music
  ☐ define rules for sequences
    ☐ sleep times
    ☐ cannot be blocking (no infinite while loops)
    ☐ general API/templates

Scheme launching:
 ☐ put light sequences into a folder
 ☐ slow down message queuing for stationary light sequences
 ☐ faster processing for active light sequences
 ✔ create launcher.py @done (11-14-16 18:28)
 ✔ alexa-based launching @done (11-15-16 00:55)

Alexa:
  ☐ update Alexa controls
  ☐ cancel
  ☐ Use AlexaSkills.js
  ✔ "Alexa, tell Carl to put on <light sequence>" @done (11-15-16 00:55)

System:
 ☐ create cron job for launching lights controller
 ☐ need to have interrupts for message processing 

Wish list:
 ☐ integrate audio processing

Documentation:
  ☐ sequence locations
    ☐ raspberryPi (as a file)
    ☐ LIST_OF_SEQUENCES (name)
    ☐ sequences.js (name and description)
    ☐ lightSequence.py (factory generator)
